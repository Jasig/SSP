	 * Logical setter on top of the {@code coach} field. I.e. if that field has not yet been set and the given ID
	 * is not {@code null}, this will set it to a new {@link AuditPerson} and assign the given ID to it. Or if that
	 * field has already been set, the given ID will just be written through to it. No other fields on {@code coach}
	 * are modified, even if the given ID is {@code null}.
	 *
	 * <p>This and the other {@code setCoach*()} methods were introduced specifically for scenarios where the underlying
	 * persistent entity is a {@link Person} rather than an {@link AuditPerson}. The other design option in that case
	 * was to just read the {@link Person} out of the db and pass it to a {@code setCoachAsPerson()} that would
	 * consolidate all the work that is currently spread out over several {@code setCoach*()} methods. But the specific
	 * queries that needed to use this mechanism were using Hibernate projections grouped by entities ({@link Person}
	 * in this case) rather than simpler entity properties, which leads to N+1 query patterns. See
	 * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4330480/prevent-hibernate-n1-selects-when-grouping-by-an-entity">this SO thread</a>.
	 * The workaround was to group by each of the fields that correspond an {@link AuditPerson}'s internals. Thus the
	 * need for the fine-grained logical setters in this class.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Since this is a logical setter and thus might not behave quite as you expect were you to invoke a corresponding
	 * getter, and to avoid any possible accidents with JSON serialization, we've elected to not define getters for these
	 * logical setters. That said, are fairly weak justifications, though, so if a need arises in the future, it's
	 * probably OK to go ahead and add them.</p>
