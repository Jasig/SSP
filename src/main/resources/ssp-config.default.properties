# Used for migrating persistent timestamps. Prior to work on SSP-1002,
# SSP-1035, and SSP-1076, timestamps were stored in the JVM default timezone.
# After that the application assumes they are stored in ${db_time_zone}. In
# order to correctly migrate existing data, though, the app needs to know
# the original timezone. This is almost always going to be the current
# JVM default timezone, hence the default value here, which is a special
# value instructing the app to lookup and inject that timezone into
# this config property. In the rare event you need to change that value,
# you can do so here. This would likely only be necessary if, for whatever
# reason you change the JVM default *after* the migrations run, which would
# result in a Liquibase checksum error. To avoid that, just set the relevant
# timezone here when and if you make that change.

# JVM-recognized TimeZone ID for the zone in which persistent date/time values

# observe Daylight Savings Time unless trying to cope with legacy data
# that was stored in a DST-aware TimeZone. Once set, should never be changed
# else date/time values in the database will be interpreted incorrectly. (SSP
# does not store timezone data on persistent date/time values and implements no
#logic for  detecting and/or handling changes to this configuration option.)
